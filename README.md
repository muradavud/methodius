Talk with ChatGPT via voice messages on Telegram!

A small, scalable, and fault-tolerant hobby project that is fully deployed on AWS. 
When I started this project, ChatGPT was still taking off, and no such solution was available on Telegram.
However, Amazon transcription services are introducing too much latency to be usable.
